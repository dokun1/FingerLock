## Summary

FingerLock is an **open-source** Swift app that lets you store your passwords and associate usernames, titles, and other notes with them. You can only access your files by TouchID, you can't share them with anyone, and the content saved to disk is scrambled in a unique way for each phone.

I really need to keep up with the times, which means I need to learn Swift. I wanted to make something practical and technically sound, yet decidedly unspectactular.

I'm always open to pull requests on the **develop** branch of this repository, as I am sure I did a lot of things that could be done easier with better knowledge of Swift. This is a learning project more than anything!!!

## Work
You are welcome to play with the code yourself, but you'll notice that the Encryptor class is mysteriously missing ;-) you can email me at **david@okun.io** if you'd like for me to fill in the blank for you!
